## General info

This project showcases my ability to build a robust and scalable portfolio site using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The site fetches data from a headless CMS.
The design of the site utilizes Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies

- Html&Css ,JavaScript.
- React - Hooks.
- Headless CMS(Contentful).
- TailwindCSS.

## Setup

To run Portfolio, ensure that you have Node.js and npm (the package manager for JavaScript) installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Once Node.js is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to install the project.

Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### How to start?

To get started, navigate to your terminal and run `npm install` to fetch all required dependencies. Once installed, execute `npm run dev` in the project directory. This will trigger the development server, allowing you to access the site at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/). Open this URL in your browser to view the portfolio in action.
